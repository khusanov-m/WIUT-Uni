## Project's Future Developments and Visions

Currently, the [Characters Page](https://00011883.netlify.app/pages/characters/index.html) of the website contains only 4 agents out of 17 characters. So, for the next development release, there will be added horizontal gallery system. Moreover, there will be items that will show clicked agent abilities and contain brief information about them.

Next, a feature that is available on all pages, namely Theme Changer needs improvements. Or rather, the adjustment of colour schemes for a light and dark theme.

Lastly but not least, regarding [News](https://00011883.netlify.app/pages/news/index.html) and [Shop](https://00011883.netlify.app/pages/shop/index.html) pages, Back-End processing is required to link articles and products to the corresponding sites.
